# Reflection

- What (if anything) did you struggle with?
I had put my if statements to check the bounds inside of the beginShape() and endShape(), which made it react really weirdly and jump around all over the place. I put it on the outside to fix it.

- What (if anything) still is not complete?
I think it is mostly complete. I added the third optional parameter to noise to add the 3d level.

- What questions (if any) do you have about this assignment?
None

- What do you feel like you understand better after having completed this?
I understand better how to use noise to add a complexity to a piece that looks organic.
